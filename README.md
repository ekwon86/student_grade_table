# Student Grade Table

### Overview

This is an application that performs CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations which essentially takes input values and applies them to objects and updates the DOM with a visual of those objects stored. Said objects in this case are names and grades of students that are added to the DOM. The data is prepopulated with data that is retreived from the LearninFuze SGT API via an AJAX function. This application was styled solely with Boostrap.

### Features I Want to Implement in Future Iterations
- [ ] **Timeout** - If data takes too long to be retrieved display an error message.
- [ ] **Local Storage** - Local state storage between page loads.
- [ ] **Object Oriented** - Apply object oriented programming to students and application.
- [ ] **Sorting** - Sort students by name / grade / course
- [ ] **Auto-Complete** - Course entry auto complete
