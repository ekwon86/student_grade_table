# Student Grade Table

### Overview

This is an application that performs CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations which essentially takes input values and applies them to objects and updates the DOM with a visual of those objects stored. Said objects in this case are names and grades of students that are added to the DOM. The data is prepopulated with data that is retreived from the LearninFuze SGT API via an AJAX function. This application was styled solely with Boostrap.

### Features I Want to Implement in Future Iterations

- [x] **Difficulty** 
- [ ] **Health Bar** - Decrement health every time user wrongly guesses. Player loses if health is depleted.
- [ ] **Timed Game** - Player can choose a timed game and the player can lose if time runs out before all cards are matched.
